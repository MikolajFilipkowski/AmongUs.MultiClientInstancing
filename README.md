# AmongUs.MultiClientInstancing

**Shoutout to MyDragonBreath for creating the original mod!**

## Description
I think the best way to describe this is as a method of host testing what your "mod" could look like with multiple clients.
It is in no way a replacement for testing your mod and has a complete disregard for rpc calls.
It can also be buggy with different mods differently depending on how they interact with amongus - so chances are its not going to be perfect.
Think of this as more like a ease-of-access utility then a standlone testing environment.

## Controls
Whilst in lobby press **F5** to add bots<br>
Press **F6** to toggle between keeping or losing bots between games<br>
**Left bracket** to move down or **right bracket** to move up through the id list<br>
Press **F11** to remove all bots.

## Disclaimer
**IMPORTANT** <br>
The mod is not designed to be the end all for testing - so expect some things not to work - please read the source to understand how this works. <br>
